# CleanQuora

I just wrote a chrome extension in 15 mins that cleans up Quora the I way I wanted to.

It would remove the complete profile information of the writer.
It would remove information regarding who wrote the answer, how may views it got, when was it written and other meta-data.
It would remove the up-vote count that answer has a the moment.
It would remove bio information
It would remove comment links
So now Quora is clean for me. Only questions and answers! Everything else is gone :)

I am sure there would be more efficient way of doing the same but this works for me as if now.
